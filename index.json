A key idea is having the first network act as a widespectrum input translator, taking in either synthetic or real images, and ideally producing minimally modified realistic images. This is done via a reconstruction loss when the training input is real, and GAN loss when synthetic, removing the need for heuristic self-regularization. The second network is trained on a task loss for synthetic image-depth pairs, with extra GAN loss to unify real and synthetic feature distributions. Importantly, the framework can be trained end-to-end, leading to good results, even surpassing early deep-learning methods that use real paired data. \nFramework \nVideo  ","date":1536336000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536336000,"objectID":"3768ff8603fdf54e6cecd84577b1c1e0","permalink":"https://www.chuanxiaz.com/publication/synthetic2real/","publishdate":"2018-09-08T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/synthetic2real/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Current methods for single-image depth estimation use training datasets with real image-depth pairs or stereo pairs, which are not easy to acquire.
